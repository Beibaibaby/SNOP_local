Daveâ€™s data. Example: areaData.LIP.evoked(1).X is the spike count matrix (in 100 ms bins) of task condition (including trial epoch and visual stimulus) 1, with size (number of trials) x (number of neurons). Another example: areaData.SC.spont is similar, but for a 1 minute chunk of the spontaneous data and for area SC instead of LIP. FEF1 and FEF2 are two electrodes. I usually just use FEF1.
